Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of pytest test cases for the user story "Conduct test coverage analysis using AI models". The test cases cover the main functionality and edge cases, including setup and teardown, and detailed comments.

Assumptions:

- There is a class/module AzureAICoverageAnalyzer that handles the connection to Azure and performs coverage analysis.
- The function analyze_coverage(test_suite, requirements) returns a CoverageAnalysisResult object with the properties: coverage_percentage and aligned_requirements.
- There is a function extract_requirements(doc) to extract requirements from the SRS document.
- Mocks are used for Azure-hosted AI model responses to avoid real Azure calls during tests.

**Notes:**
- Fixtures provide setup and teardown for SRS content, requirements, test suite, and analyzer.
- Each test is commented and designed to test specific acceptance criteria and edge cases.
- The Azure AI model is mocked to focus on business logic and coverage, not actual Azure integration.
- The structure ensures clarity and maintainability.
