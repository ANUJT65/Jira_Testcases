Certainly! Below are comprehensive pytest test cases for the described user story. These tests cover main functionalities and edge cases, including role-based access, collaboration actions, and security. Each test is well-commented and uses setup/teardown to ensure test isolation.

Assumptions for the pseudo-system-under-test:

- There is a `User` class with a `role` attribute.
- There is a `Requirement` class for collaborative artifacts.
- Access control is enforced via a function/method `can_access(user, requirement)`.
- Collaboration actions (view, edit, comment) are methods on the `Requirement` object, which check user permissions.
- Stakeholders can collaborate; other roles (e.g., guest) should be restricted.

You can adapt these for your actual codebase.

```python
import pytest

# --- Mock classes/functions for demonstration; replace with your implementations ---

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, role):
        self.username = username
        self.role = role

class Requirement:
    def __init__(self, content, collaborators=None):
        self.content = content
        self.collaborators = collaborators or []

    def can_access(self, user):
        # Only stakeholders can access
        return user.role == 'stakeholder'

    def view(self, user):
        if not self.can_access(user):
            raise PermissionError("Access denied")
        return self.content

    def edit(self, user, new_content):
        if not self.can_access(user):
            raise PermissionError("Access denied")
        self.content = new_content

    def comment(self, user, comment_text):
        if not self.can_access(user):
            raise PermissionError("Access denied")
        # Just a placeholder for comment action
        return f"{user.username} commented: {comment_text}"

**Notes:**
- Replace mock implementations with your actual system's classes and methods.
- The tests cover main flows (stakeholder access), negative scenarios (guests/invalid roles), concurrent collaboration, and edge cases (no role, deleted objects).
- Each test is isolated by using pytest fixtures for setup and teardown.
- Comments are provided for clarity and maintainability.
