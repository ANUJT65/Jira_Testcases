**Notes:**
- These tests assume a simplified role-based permission system. In practice, the RBAC system should prevent permission escalation (see the last test).
- The fixtures ensure proper setup and teardown.
- Edge cases include null/empty users and actions.
- Each test is commented for clarity and to map to the user story's acceptance criteria.
