Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of **pytest** test cases for the described user story. The test suite covers main flows and edge cases for extracting requirements from PDFs, Word, Excel, and images. Proper setup and teardown are included, and each test is commented for clarity.

Assumptions:
- The main function under test is `extract_requirements(file_path: str) -> list[dict]`, which returns a list of structured requirements as dictionaries.
- The system raises a `ValueError` for unsupported or corrupted files.
- Sample test files are located in a temporary directory for testing.

```python
import pytest
import shutil
import os
from pathlib import Path

# Assume this is the main function provided by the requirement extraction system
from requirement_extractor import extract_requirements

# Test data directory
TEST_DATA_DIR = Path(__file__).parent / "test_data"

# Additional edge/test cases can be added as needed, e.g., highly nested documents, encrypted files, etc.
```

**Notes:**
- Each test is documented with comments.
- Setup/teardown is managed by a `pytest` fixture using a temporary directory.
- The test data files (e.g., `sample_requirements.pdf`, `corrupted.docx`, etc.) should be provided in the test suite's `test_data` directory.
- The function under test (`extract_requirements`) should handle file reading, AI extraction, and error handling as per the requirements.
