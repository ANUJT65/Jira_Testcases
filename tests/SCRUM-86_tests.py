Certainly! Below is a well-structured set of **pytest** test cases for the user story, with setup/teardown, clear comments, and coverage of main and edge cases.

Assumptions:

- There is a function send_task_notification(task_status, user_email, error_details=None, suggestions=None) that sends emails.
- A mock email service is used for testing.
- We'll use fixtures for setup/teardown.
- We'll test both success and failure scenarios, and edge cases (missing email, empty error details, etc.).

**Notes:**
- Each test is self-contained and uses fixtures for setup.
- Edge cases (missing email, missing error/suggestions) are covered.
- Mocking ensures no real emails are sent.
- Use `pytest` features for clarity and maintainability.
- Adjust function names or imports if your actual implementation differs.
