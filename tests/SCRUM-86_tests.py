Certainly! Below are **comprehensive pytest test cases** for the user story: *Send email notifications for task completion or failures*. The tests cover main functionalities and edge cases, with setup and teardown, and are clearly commented for clarity.

Assumptions:
- There is a function `send_task_notification(task_status, user_email, error_details=None)` that sends emails.
- There is a mock email backend or service to capture outgoing emails.
- The error details and suggested actions are included in failure notifications.

You can adapt function and module names to your implementation.

```python
import pytest

# Mocked email backend for testing purposes
class MockEmailBackend:
    def __init__(self):
        self.outbox = []

    def send_email(self, subject, to, body):
        self.outbox.append({'subject': subject, 'to': to, 'body': body})

    def clear(self):
        self.outbox = []

# The function under test (to be implemented in your codebase)
def send_task_notification(task_status, user_email, email_backend, error_details=None):
    """

    task_status: 'success' or 'failure'

    email_backend: email backend instance
    error_details: dict with 'error' and 'suggested_actions' (optional)
    """
    if task_status == 'success':
        subject = "Dormant Account Task Completed"
        body = "Your dormant account review task has been completed successfully."
    elif task_status == 'failure':
        subject = "Dormant Account Task Failed"
        if not error_details or 'error' not in error_details or 'suggested_actions' not in error_details:
            body = "Task failed, but error details are missing."
        else:
            body = (
                f"Task failed with error: {error_details['error']}\n"
                f"Suggested actions: {error_details['suggested_actions']}"
            )
    else:

**Notes:**
- These tests can be run with `pytest`.
- The mock email backend simulates capturing outgoing emails for assertions.
- Edge cases include missing details, invalid statuses, and empty email addresses.
- Setup and teardown are managed via fixtures.
- Each test function is commented to explain its purpose.

You may need to adjust exception types and handling based on your actual implementation. Let me know if you need integration with your actual email sending library or more advanced mocking!
