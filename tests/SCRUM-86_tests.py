Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of pytest test cases for the given user story. The test suite is designed to cover both main functionalities (notifications for task completion and failures) as well as relevant edge cases. Setup and teardown procedures are included, with clear comments for each test case.

Assumptions:

- There exists a function send_task_notification(task_status, user_email, details=None) that sends the email.
- The email sending is mocked for testability.
- The mock_email_service is used to capture sent emails for assertions.

```python
import pytest

# Mock email service to capture sent emails
class MockEmailService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sent_emails = []

    def send_email(self, to, subject, body):
        self.sent_emails.append({'to': to, 'subject': subject, 'body': body})

    def reset(self):
        self.sent_emails = []

**How to Use:**
- Place this code in your test file (e.g., `test_notifications.py`).
- Replace the `send_task_notification` function with your actual implementation.
- Adjust the mock email service as needed to match your production email sending abstraction.
- Run with `pytest`.

**Whatâ€™s Covered:**
- Notification on successful completion.
- Notification on failure with required error and action details.
- Edge cases: missing details, invalid status, missing email, unusual email addresses.
- Multiple notifications in sequence.
- Clean setup/teardown for isolation.

Let me know if you need the code adapted for a different function signature or email sending abstraction!
