**Notes:**
- Replace `your_module` with the actual module name where `send_email` and `notify_task_status` are defined.
- The `setup_and_teardown` fixture uses `mock.patch` to replace the `send_email` function across all tests, ensuring no real emails are sent.
- Each test is annotated with comments explaining its purpose and covering main flow and edge cases.
- The tests cover positive flows, negative flows, and edge scenarios as per the acceptance criteria and user story.
