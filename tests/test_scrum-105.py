Certainly! Here are comprehensive **pytest** test cases for the user story, focusing on CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker. These tests are designed for a repository containing a sample application, its Dockerfile, and GitHub Actions workflow files. The tests use Python's subprocess and requests libraries to simulate build, test, and deploy steps. Mocks and fixtures are used for setup/teardown.

**Notes:**
- These tests assume Docker and pytest are installed and running locally.
- Replace `REPO_URL`, `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME`, and `DEPLOY_ENDPOINT` with actual values.
- In real-world scenarios, mocks or CI test runners may replace some subprocess calls.
- Tests are commented for clarity and grouped by acceptance criteria (main and edge cases).
- Each test is independent and uses fixtures for setup/teardown.

Let me know if you need these adapted to a different framework or with more advanced mocking!
