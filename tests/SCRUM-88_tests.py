**Notes:**

- Each test case includes a docstring describing its purpose.
- The fixture handles setup/teardown common to all tests.
- Helper functions should be implemented according to your applicationâ€™s environment or mocked as needed.
- Edge cases include missing email address and role restrictions.
- All assertions have clear error messages for easier debugging.
- `mock_email_service` is a simple in-memory mock for illustration; replace or extend as needed for your real testing environment.
