Certainly! Below are comprehensive pytest test cases for the described user story, structured clearly and with setup/teardown, thorough coverage (including main and edge cases), and descriptive comments.

Assumptions:

- There is a RequirementExtractor class implementing RAG-based extraction, with a method fill_missing_data(srs_document).
- The function returns the completed requirements with missing fields filled in.
- The RAG system has access to an external knowledge base or retrieval mechanism (mocked in tests).

```python
import pytest

# Mock RequirementExtractor for demonstration
class RequirementExtractor:
    def __init__(self, knowledge_base):
        self.knowledge_base = knowledge_base

    def fill_missing_data(self, srs_document):
        # This function should use RAG techniques to fill missing data.
        # Here we mock the behavior for test illustration.
        completed_requirements = []
        for req in srs_document:
            filled_req = req.copy()
            for key, value in req.items():
                if value is None:
                    # Simulate retrieval and generation
                    filled_req[key] = self.knowledge_base.get(key, "UNKNOWN")
            completed_requirements.append(filled_req)
        return completed_requirements

**Notes:**
- The code is designed for clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.
- Each test case targets a specific acceptance criterion or edge case.
- Setup/teardown uses pytest fixtures.
- Comments explain the intention of each test.
- The RequirementExtractor and its method are mock implementations for illustrative purposes; replace them with your actual RAG implementation as needed.
