Certainly! Below are comprehensive pytest test cases for the given user story, structured for clarity, coverage, and best practices. These tests assume a function/class named RequirementExtractor, with a .extract_requirements() method that uses RAG to fill missing data. You can adapt the function/class names to suit your implementation.

```

**Key Points:**
- Setup and teardown are handled via class methods.
- Each test case is clearly documented with comments.
- Positive cases (basic, bulk, type preservation) and edge cases (null input, unrecoverable, partial data) are covered.
- Type preservation and consistency checks are included.
- The interface is generic; adapt to your actual implementation as needed.
