Certainly! Below are comprehensive pytest test cases for the described user story, covering main functionality and edge cases for the RAG-based requirement extraction system. Each test is commented for clarity, and proper setup/teardown is included via fixtures.

Assumptions:

- The RAG system exposes a function: fill_missing_data(requirement: dict, source_document: str) â†’ dict.
- The "requirement" dict may have missing fields to be filled.
- The system uses "srs" (Software Requirements Specification) as its knowledge base.
- The test file can use mock objects to simulate RAG responses.

```python
import pytest

**Notes:**
- Replace the mock fill_missing_data() function with the actual system under test.
- These tests check main paths, edge cases (empty SRS, missing fields, large documents, Unicode handling), and batch behavior.
- All tests are self-contained and use fixtures for consistent setup and teardown.
- Adjust as needed for the actual API and data model of your RAG system.
