Certainly! Here are comprehensive pytest test cases for the user story "Use RAG techniques to intelligently fill missing data during requirement extraction." These cover main functionalities and edge cases, include setup/teardown, and are well-commented.

# Teardown is handled automatically by pytest fixtures.
# If you need to close resources, use `yield` fixtures or add explicit teardown code.

```

**Key Points:**
- Each test case validates a key functionality or edge case based on the user story and acceptance criteria.
- Setup is accomplished via `pytest` fixtures.
- Teardown is handled implicitly, but custom teardown can be added if needed.
- Comments describe the purpose of each test.
- The tests are structured to be clear and maintainable.

If you have a real implementation of the RAG engine or requirement extractor, replace the mocks accordingly.
