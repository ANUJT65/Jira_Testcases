Certainly! Below are comprehensive pytest test cases for the user story described. The test cases assume the presence of a RAGRequirementExtractor class (or similar) that implements the RAG-based extraction and filling logic. Mocking is used where appropriate to isolate the RAG logic.

```python
import pytest

# Sample implementation interface to be tested
class RAGRequirementExtractor:
    def __init__(self, source_document):
        self.source_document = source_document
        # Assume some initialization

    def extract_requirements(self):
        """
        Extracts requirements from the source document,
        intelligently fills missing data using RAG techniques.
        Returns a list of requirement dicts.
        """

# Teardown is handled by pytest fixtures' scope and automatic cleanup.
```

**Notes:**
- Replace MockRAGRequirementExtractor with your actual implementation or adapt the mocking logic.
- Every test has a docstring explaining its purpose.
- The `extractor` fixture provides a clean instance for each test.
- Edge cases such as empty documents, all fields missing, and bad types are covered.
- Setup and teardown are managed via pytest fixtures for isolation and easy expansion.
