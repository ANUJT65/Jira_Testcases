**Notes:**

- Replace `API_ENDPOINT` with your actual endpoint.
- For real concurrency in `test_api_response_time_under_peak_load`, consider using `concurrent.futures` or `pytest-asyncio` if your API supports async.
- The `monkeypatch` fixture and mocks are used so tests can run without a real API.
- Adjust sample transactions and edge cases to match your business logic.
- Each test is commented for clarity and covers both main and edge cases as per the user story and acceptance criteria.
