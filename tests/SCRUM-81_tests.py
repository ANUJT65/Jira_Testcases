**Notes:**
- Each test is annotated with a descriptive docstring.
- Setup and teardown are managed via pytest fixtures.
- Main functionality (stakeholder access, guest/admin checks) and edge cases (unknown role, permissions misconfiguration, audit logging, multiple users) are covered.
- The code uses mock classes to simulate the platform and users; in real tests, these would be replaced with actual implementations or appropriate mocks.
