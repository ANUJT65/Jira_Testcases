Certainly! Below are comprehensive pytest test cases for the described user story, focusing on **stakeholder** role-based access control and collaboration features. The tests include setup and teardown, positive (main functionality) and negative (edge) scenarios, and are well-commented for clarity.

Assumptions:

- There's a User model with roles.
- There's an AccessControl system enforcing permissions.
- Collaboration features (e.g., create, view, comment on documents) exist.
- A test fixture/database is used for setup/cleanup.

```python

# Mock classes/functions to illustrate structure (replace with actual implementations)
class User:
    def __init__(self, username, role):
        self.username = username
        self.role = role

class AccessControl:
    @staticmethod
    def can_access_feature(user, feature):
        # Example: Only stakeholders can access 'collaboration' features
        if user.role == 'stakeholder' and feature in ['collaboration', 'view', 'comment']:
            return True
        return False

**Notes:**
- Replace mock classes with your actual application code/interfaces.
- Extend fixtures for more complex setup/teardown if your system requires.
- These tests cover positive, negative, and edge cases for stakeholder role-based collaboration.
- Each test includes comments explaining its purpose for maintainability and clarity.
