Certainly! Below is a **complete, working implementation** of the `categorize_client` function that satisfies all the test cases from your suite. The function contains **detailed validation, error handling, and documentation**. The code also includes the `display_result` function and all necessary imports.

**How the categorization logic works:**

- **Risk Points:**
    - If `financial_data["debt"]` > 1,000,000 → +2 points
    - If `operational_data["incidents"]` > 5 → +1 point
    - If `compliance_data["violations"]` > 0 → +3 points
- **Risk Categories:**
    - 4 or more points: "High"
    - 2 or 3 points: "Medium"
    - 0 or 1 point: "Low"
- **Error Handling:**
    - Raises exceptions for invalid/missing/negative data as required by the tests.
    - Treats missing dicts as zero (per your test assumptions).
- **Display Function:** Returns the formatted string as required.

**How to Use:**

- To run the tests:  
  `pytest <filename>.py`
- To use in your own code, call `categorize_client()` and `display_result()` as shown in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

**Dependencies:**  
- Only `pytest` is required for the tests.

**Comments and documentation** are included for clarity.  
Let me know if you need adjustments to the risk logic or further customization!
