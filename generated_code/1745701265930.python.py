Certainly! Below is a complete Python code to generate the Fibonacci series, with clear comments and an example usage.

```python
# No external imports are needed for Fibonacci series generation

def fibonacci_series(n):
    """
    Generate the Fibonacci series up to n terms.

    Args:
        n (int): Number of terms to generate in the series (must be >= 0).

    Returns:
        list: List containing the Fibonacci series up to n terms.

    Example:
        >>> fibonacci_series(5)
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
    """
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    series = [0, 1]  # The first two terms of Fibonacci series
    for i in range(2, n):
        next_term = series[-1] + series[-2]  # Sum of the last two terms
        series.append(next_term)
    return series

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_terms = 10  # Specify how many terms you want
    fib_series = fibonacci_series(num_terms)
    print(f"Fibonacci series with {num_terms} terms: {fib_series}")
```

### Notes:
- No external dependencies are needed.
- The function handles edge cases (e.g., n = 0 or n = 1).
- To use: Just call `fibonacci_series(n)` where `n` is the number of terms you want.
- The example prints the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci series.
