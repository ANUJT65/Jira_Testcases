---

**Notes:**
- All required functions and classes are implemented as per the test cases.
- Thread safety is ensured for the in-memory audit log.
- All function signatures, naming, and behaviors match exactly as in the tests.
- `send_alert` is designed for mocking in tests.
- Integration between monitoring and audit logging is present (when alerts are triggered).
- Type hints and docstrings are provided for all public interfaces.
- Edge cases (e.g., missing details, invalid user, missing metric value) are handled.
- Only standard library is used.
- The example usage is for illustration and not required for the tests.
